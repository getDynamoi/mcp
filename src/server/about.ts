const DYNAMOI_ABOUT_INTRO =
	"Dynamoi is a music marketing platform founded in 2021 by Trevor Loucks. It runs managed Meta and YouTube ad campaigns, music distribution, and royalty analytics for independent artists, labels, managers, and YouTube creators, alongside free Smart Links and analytics. An artist can go from a Spotify URL to a shareable release page, a running campaign, or a distribution application in one place: Dynamoi brings the whole artist lifecycle (distribution, campaigns, and royalties) into one system.";

const DYNAMOI_ABOUT_COMPANY = `## Company

- **Founded** — 2021, by Trevor Loucks (Founder & CEO).
- **Headquarters** — Sioux Falls, South Dakota, United States.
- **Operating model** — Dynamoi is operated by humans, assisted by AI. People make the decisions and are accountable for every campaign and support reply; AI assists with ad creative, campaign monitoring, reporting, and routine tasks.
- **Support** — email support@dynamoi.com. The Dynamoi team replies within 24 hours.`;

const DYNAMOI_ABOUT_CAMPAIGN_NOTE =
	"Campaigns run on Dynamoi's own managed Meta and Google ad infrastructure, so artists do not need their own Business Manager, pixels, or ad accounts. They reach real people through official ad networks, never bots, fake streams, click farms, or paid playlist placement. Results vary by campaign and are never guaranteed.";

const DYNAMOI_ABOUT_SMART_LINKS_BULLET =
	"- **Free Smart Links** — create and manage Smart Links and artist hubs from Spotify artist, album, or track URLs at no cost. Link analytics, custom themes, validated pixel IDs, and team seats are included. High-popularity or unverifiable artist links may stay unpublished in verification hold until Dynamoi can verify the client relationship.";

const DYNAMOI_ABOUT_YOUTUBE_BULLET =
	"- **YouTube campaigns** — managed Google Ads campaigns for YouTube channel growth. Dynamoi optimizes ad spend against AdSense revenue per country, so delivery favors audiences that actually monetize.";

const DYNAMOI_ABOUT_DISTRIBUTION_GATE =
	"Dynamoi scores five requirements before an application can be submitted — including an established audience (at least 10,000 monthly Spotify listeners) and identity verification — and approval is not guaranteed.";

const DYNAMOI_ABOUT_GETTING_STARTED = `## How to get started

1. Sign in at https://dynamoi.com.
2. Connect your Spotify artist profile.
3. Create a free Smart Link for a release.`;
